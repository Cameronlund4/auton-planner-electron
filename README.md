## Setup
**Getting started with CHEAP is relatively easy, and can be done in 5 simple steps:**

1) Download the repository by typing the following in [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or anywhere else you have git shell access:

    `git clone https://github.com/Cameronlund4/auton-planner-electron.git`

2) Next, you'll need to be sure you have node.js installed on your system. It can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

3) Using node, we need to install the [electron package](https://electron.atom.io/) globally:

    `npm install -g electron --save-dev`

4) We also need to install the [electron forge package](https://electronforge.io/) globally:

    `npm install -g electron-forge`

5) Now, in the directory of the downloaded source, the following command needs to be run to install dependencies for the project:

    `npm install`

That's it! Now make any changes to the code in your preferred editor (we suggest [atom](https://atom.io/)) and run the code using either `npm start` or `electron-forge start` in your root directory.
